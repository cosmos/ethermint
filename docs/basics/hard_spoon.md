## Hard Spoon on Ethermint

A [hard spoon](https://blog.cosmos.network/introducing-the-hard-spoon-4a9288d3f0df) is the migration of the snapshot of a target blockchain's state into a new chain. The state of a network can be imported (or "scooped") onto a separate chain to accurately replicate the account balances and other information from the state.

Ethermint's Hard Spoon tool (currently under specification) is targeted to import the state of the Ethereum mainnet to replicate the state for the given accounts. This will allow anyone on the Ethereum network to import their contracts into Ethermint.
