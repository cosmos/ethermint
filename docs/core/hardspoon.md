# Hard Spoon

## Overview

A hard spoon is the migration of the snapshot of a target blockchain's state into a new chain. The state of a network can be imported onto a separate chain to accurately replicate the account balances and other information.

## Hard Spoon on Ethermint

Ethermint's hard spoon functionality (under development) is targeted to import the state of the Ethereum main network to replicate the correct balances of all users. This will allow anyone on the Ethereum network to jump into the Ethermint network by importing their private key, and they will be able to redeem their original ETH balance on the Ethermint chain as fee tokens.
